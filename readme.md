# Node.JS TypeScript Template

This template includes my standard configuration for a Node.js and TypeScript project. The linter and formatter have been configured, as well as the GitHub Actions workflows.

## Usage

To use this template, click the "Use this template" button above. You will be prompted to enter the name of your new repository. Once you have done so, you will be redirected to your new repository.

You are welcome to extend and overwrite the configs as you desire (please do not PR your changes back to this template, these changes will be rejected).

TypeScript will read from the `src` directory and compile to a `build` directory.
